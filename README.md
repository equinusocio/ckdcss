## Why?

> Itâ€™s likely that you started your day with a micro-interaction. By turning off the alarm on your mobile phone, you engaged with a user interface in a single moment.

> You will continue to engage throughout the day in these moments with your digital devices. Each one is a micro-interaction. Each one is probably so small you donâ€™t think about it. And each one works because of that simple fact.

> As a designer, recognizing the invisibility of micro-interactions is just as important as designing them. You have to create something that feels human and accomplishes a task, making the life of a user easier. You also have to focus on a design that can work in a variety of environments and does not need any instruction or explanation.

## Installation

### As dependency

You can install **ckd-css** as node dependency by using [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ckd-css) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

```bash
npm install ckd-css --save
```

Then import the desired animation inside your component:

```js
import 'ckd-css/dist/pulse.css';
```

### From source

If you are using PostCSS, you can also import animations from the `src/lib/animations` folder, but you need a specific [plugins configuration](https://github.com/equinusocio/ckdcss/blob/develop/config/postcss.config.js).

### From CDN

You can link the animation you want from CDN

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ckd-css/dist/pulse.css">
```

We also provide the full collection (all animations) in a single file, but we strongly recommend to link only the css you need.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ckd-css/dist/ckd.css">
```

## Usage

To activate the animation add the `data-ckd` attribute to your radio/checkbox html element.

```html
<input type="checkbox" data-ckd="splash" />
```
